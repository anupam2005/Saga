LGNDM FileSystem as a Service (FSaS): Whitelist Verification Using LDAP

The LGNDM FileSystem as a Service (FSaS) leverages LDAP to store and manage the whitelisted file paths. All requests to FSaS are routed through a DataPower gateway named IBUS.

Request Processing Flow:

Caller Identification:
Upon receiving a request, IBUS identifies the caller based on the provided certificate.

Whitelist Verification:
After identifying the caller, IBUS checks the directories the caller is permitted to access, referencing the whitelist stored in LDAP.

Response Handling:

If the callerâ€™s access is validated against the whitelist, the request is forwarded to FSaS for further processing.
If the whitelist verification fails, IBUS immediately blocks the request and returns an error response.


Operational Rationale for Externalizing the Whitelist:
Storing the whitelist in LDAP provides flexibility and operational efficiency. This approach allows the team to update the whitelist dynamically, without requiring code changes or redeployments, ensuring seamless adaptability to access requirements.
