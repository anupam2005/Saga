Objective: Requesting UCD onboarding exception clearance for NEViewerUI & NEViewerService.

Justification:
We are in the process of transitioning ownership of the existing NEViewer PCF portal from AppId SAE to LGEDA due to the dissolution of the SAE development group. This is a critical change that requires swift action to ensure smooth continuity and management.

Additionally, these components are expected to have a short lifespan and are planned for retirement by Q2-2025. Onboarding them under UCD now will streamline their management and enable us to retire them efficiently when the time comes.

Given that all applications under LGEDA are already using UCD, integrating NEViewerUI and NEViewerService into this system will ensure consistency across our operations, reduce the complexity of managing different platforms, and ultimately save time and resources. This proactive approach will simplify the decommissioning process and maintain operational alignment.

For these reasons, we respectfully request an exception clearance to onboard these components under UCD.
